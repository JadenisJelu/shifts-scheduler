# scheduler

This is a simple scheduler I created.

How to use it:
1. Instantiate an "Operation" class
2. Set operating hours
3. Set workers' shift hours
4. Add workers
5. Set workers' available times
6. Call scheduler to schedule
7. Call scheduler viewer

Example output in terminal:

What it can do:
- assign equal shifts for workers
- adapt for different shift hours and operating hours

What it can't do ( yet! ;) ):
- dynamic allocation of worker availability times
- multiple versions of schedule
- continuos shift prioritization
- granularity adjustments (ie. hours, days, weeks, months)

Welcome suggestions and feedback!
